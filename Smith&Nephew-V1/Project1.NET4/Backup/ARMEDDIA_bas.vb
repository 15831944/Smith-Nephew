		'Input:-
		'        nDisplay is the value as input by the operator in the
		'        dialog.
		'        The convention is that, Metric dimensions use the decimal
		'        point to indicate the division between CMs and mms
		'        ie 7.6 = 7 cm and 6 mm.
		'        Whereas the decimal point for imperial measurements indicates
